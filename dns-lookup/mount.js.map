DNS propagation is the process of updating DNS values across all DNS servers and waiting for users caches to invalidate.\n                <br><br>\n                Due to various caches at user and DNS server levels, it may take some time for all your users to see the new records.\n                <br><br>\n                If you use a fast updating DNS such as {link|Cloudflare

For Debian based distributions, run <code>sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches</code>.\n                <br><br>\n                <b>macOS:</b> Open Terminal and run the command <code>sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder</code>.\n                <br><br>\n                <b>iPadOS:</b> Turning off and on Airplane mode will flush your DNS cache.\n                <hr>\n                If you are still unable to get the correct results, you can check the propagation status using a {link|propagation checker|{{DEEPLINK}}}.\n    `,\n    title: \"DNS Propagation\",\n};\n","\"use strict\";\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\nexports.default = {\n    downloadRecords: \"Download Records\",\n    downloadTextForm: \"Download Records In Text Form\",\n    copyTextForm: \"Copy Records In Text Form\",\n    downloadMd: \"Download Records In Markdown\",\n    copyMd: \"Copy Records In Markdown\",\n};\n","\"use strict\";\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\nexports.default = {\n    learnMore: \"Learn more\",\n    noRecords: \"Could not find any records of this type.\",\n    propagation: \"Why do I get different values on my local system?\",\n    learnHow: \"Learn how to set {record} records with your DNS/registrar.\",\n    propagationNote: \"Google DNS is reporting different values.
